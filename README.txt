How to use the mod:
Craft a spear with | stick | stick | (material) |, also mirrored.
Spears can be thrown using right mouse button, they either hurt someone or stick where they land on; damage depends on speed and material, flight trajectory is ballistic with drag.
Spears can be used to fight, but are slower and weaker than swords.
Spears can be used to dig, but are slower and weaker and pickaxes.
You can grab a spear on the fly (or maybe wait until it falls).
If you feel even clever, throw a spear right above you and look at it to see what happens.
Someone was reported to have hit its own foot but it takes practice.
